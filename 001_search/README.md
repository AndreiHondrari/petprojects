# Search procedures comparison

## Overview

Typically when you search over a set of data items, for sets that are rather small in size the search is very fast, but as the size of the collection grows substantially the performance of the search starts to be affected.

The search performance varies depending on a number of factors:
- the data structure that keeps the collection
- the grade of order in the collection
- the type of information being searched
- the combination of algorithms used in a search procedure and the order of their usage
